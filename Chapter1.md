## Exercise 1.2 ##
**Read Turing's original paper on AI (Turing, 1950). In the paper, he discusses several
potential objections to his proposed enterprise and his test for intelligence. Which objections
still carry some weight? Are his refutations valid? Can you think of new objections arising from
developments since he wrote the paper? In the paper, he predicts that by the year 2000, a computer
will have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test with an unskilled interrogator. Do
you think this is reasonable?**

### Solution ###
The objections that are still commonly used are:

 - Consciousness objection that machines can't feel emotions in the same way as humans
 - Lady Lovelace's objection that machines can only do what they are programmed

His refutations are valid but they work by clarifying what it means to be intelligent

New objections may include things like that computers are designed to be sequential rather than parallel
and whether it's possible to have computer based parallel cores operate quickly enough to simulate a brain

Chat-bots are quite widely used (often for scamming people). This shows that if a person assumes they
are talking with a human that they can be quite easily fooled.


## Exercise 1.4 ##
**Suppose we extend Evans's ANALOGY program so that it can score 200 on a standard IQ
test. Would we then have a program more intelligent than a human? Explain**

### Solution ###
No. Intelligence is the skill of generating and applying accurate predictive models of the world
based on percepts, actions, and rewards. An IQ test focuses more on pattern recognition and state manipulation
which is only a subset of this.


## Exercise 1.14 ##
**Examine the AI literature to discover whether or not the following tasks can currently be
solved by computers:**

a. Playing a decent game of table tennis (ping-pong).
b. Driving in the center of Cairo, Egypt.
f. Playing a decent game of bridge at a competitive level.
g. Discovering and proving new mathematical theorems.
h. Writing an intentionally funny story.
i. Giving competent legal advice in a specialized area of law.
j. Translating spoken English into spoken Swedish in real time.

For the currently infeasible tasks, try to find out what the difficulties are and estimate when they
will be overcome.

### Solution ###
a. Yes

b. Yes

f. Yes

g. Yes

h. No - Generating surprise and finding hidden relationships in language/life

i. Yes

j. Yes


## Exercise 1.11 ##
**"Surely computers cannot be intelligent—they can only do what their programmers tell
them." Is the latter statement true, and does it imply the former?**

### Solution ###
Yes, No. It just needs to be programmed in a flexible way that allows for internal decisions to alter internal functions


## Exercise 1.12 ##
**"Surely animals cannot be intelligent—they can only do what their genes tell them." Is
the latter statement true, and does it imply the former?**

### Solution ###
Yes, No. The brain operates in a flexible way allowing for the process described above
