# 7. Logical Agents

**7.1** Suppose the agent has progressed to the point shown in
Figure [wumpus-seq35-figure](#/)(a), page [wumpus-seq35-figure](#/),
having perceived nothing in \[1,1\], a breeze in \[2,1\], and a stench
in \[1,2\], and is now concerned with the contents of \[1,3\], \[2,2\],
and \[3,1\]. Each of these can contain a pit, and at most one can
contain a wumpus. Following the example of
Figure [wumpus-entailment-figure](#/), construct the set of
possible worlds. (You should find 32 of them.) Mark the worlds in which
the KB is true and those in which each of the following sentences is
true:

$\alpha_2$ = “There is no pit in [2,2].”

$\alpha_3$ = “There is a wumpus in [1,3].”

Hence show that ${KB} {\models}\alpha_2$ and
${KB} {\models}\alpha_3$.

**7.2** (Adapted from @Barwise+Etchemendy:1993 .) Given the following, can you prove that the unicorn is
mythical? How about magical? Horned?

> If the unicorn is mythical, then it is immortal, but if it is not
> mythical, then it is a mortal mammal. If the unicorn is either
> immortal or a mammal, then it is horned. The unicorn is magical if it
> is horned.

**7.3** \[truth-value-exercise\] Consider the problem of deciding whether a
propositional logic sentence is true in a given model.

1.  Write a recursive algorithm PL-True?$ (s, m )$ that returns ${true}$ if and
    only if the sentence $s$ is true in the model $m$ (where $m$ assigns
    a truth value for every symbol in $s$). The algorithm should run in
    time linear in the size of the sentence. (Alternatively, use a
    version of this function from the online code repository.)

2.  Give three examples of sentences that can be determined to be true
    or false in a *partial* model that does not specify a
    truth value for some of the symbols.

3.  Show that the truth value (if any) of a sentence in a partial model
    cannot be determined efficiently in general.

4.  Modify your algorithm so that it can sometimes judge truth from
    partial models, while retaining its recursive structure and linear
    run time. Give three examples of sentences whose truth in a partial
    model is *not* detected by your algorithm.

5.  Investigate whether the modified algorithm makes $TT-Entails?$ more efficient.

    is satisfiable.

12. $(A{\;\;{\Leftrightarrow}\;\;}B) {\;\;{\Leftrightarrow}\;\;}C$ has
    the same number of models as $(A{\;\;{\Leftrightarrow}\;\;}B)$ for
    any fixed set of proposition symbols that includes $A$, $B$, $C$.

Table \[logical-equivalence-table\] (page [logical-equivalence-table](#/)).

**7.12** \[propositional-validity-exercise\]Decide whether each of the following

**7.14** \[cnf-proof-exercise\] Any propositional logic sentence is logically
equivalent to the assertion that each possible world in which it would
be false is not the case. From this observation, prove that any sentence
can be written in CNF.

**7.15** Use resolution to prove the sentence $\lnot A \land \lnot B$ from the
clauses in Exercise [convert-clausal-exercise](#/).

**7.16** \[inf-exercise\] This exercise looks into the relationship between
clauses and implication sentences.

1.  Show that the clause $(\lnot P_1 \lor \cdots \lor \lnot P_m \lor Q)$
    is logically equivalent to the implication sentence
    $(P_1 \land \cdots \land P_m) {\;{\Rightarrow}\;}Q$.

2.  Show that every clause (regardless of the number of
    positive literals) can be written in the form
    $(P_1 \land \cdots \land P_m) {\;{\Rightarrow}\;}(Q_1 \lor \cdots \lor Q_n)$,
    where the $P$s and $Q$s are proposition symbols. A knowledge base
    consisting of such sentences is in implicative normal form or **Kowalski
    form** @Kowalski:1979.

3.  Write down the full resolution rule for sentences in implicative
    normal form.

**7.17** According to some political pundits, a person who is radical ($R$) is
electable ($E$) if he/she is conservative ($C$), but otherwise is not
electable.

1.  Which of the following are correct representations of this
    assertion?

    1.  $(R\land E)\iff C$

    2.  $R{\:\;{\Rightarrow}\:\;}(E\iff C)$

    3.  $R{\:\;{\Rightarrow}\:\;}((C{\:\;{\Rightarrow}\:\;}E) \lor \lnot E)$

2.  Which of the sentences in (a) can be expressed in Horn form?

**7.18** This question considers representing satisfiability (SAT) problems as
CSPs.

1.  Draw the constraint graph corresponding to the SAT problem
    $$(\lnot X_1 \lor X_2) \land (\lnot X_2 \lor X_3) \land \ldots \land (\lnot X_{n-1} \lor X_n)$$
    for the particular case $n{{\,{=}\,}}5$.

2.  How many solutions are there for this general SAT problem as a
    function of $n$?

3.  Suppose we apply {Backtracking-Search} (page [backtracking-search-algorithm](#/)) to find *all*
    solutions to a SAT CSP of the type given in (a). (To find
    *all* solutions to a CSP, we simply modify the basic
    algorithm so it continues searching after each solution is found.)
    Assume that variables are ordered $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ and ${false}$
    is ordered before ${true}$. How much time will the algorithm take
    to terminate? (Write an $O(\cdot)$ expression as a function of $n$.)

4.  We know that SAT problems in Horn form can be solved in linear time
    by forward chaining (unit propagation). We also know that every
    tree-structured binary CSP with discrete, finite domains can be
    solved in time linear in the number of variables
    (Section [csp-structure-section](#/)). Are these two
    facts connected? Discuss.

**7.19** This question considers representing satisfiability (SAT) problems as
CSPs.

1.  Draw the constraint graph corresponding to the SAT problem
    $$(\lnot X_1 \lor X_2) \land (\lnot X_2 \lor X_3) \land \ldots \land (\lnot X_{n-1} \lor X_n)$$
    for the particular case $n{{\,{=}\,}}4$.

2.  How many solutions are there for this general SAT problem as a
    function of $n$?

3.  Suppose we apply {Backtracking-Search} (page [backtracking-search-algorithm](#/)) to find *all*
    solutions to a SAT CSP of the type given in (a). (To find
    *all* solutions to a CSP, we simply modify the basic
    algorithm so it continues searching after each solution is found.)
    Assume that variables are ordered $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ and ${false}$
    is ordered before ${true}$. How much time will the algorithm take
    to terminate? (Write an $O(\cdot)$ expression as a function of $n$.)

4.  We know that SAT problems in Horn form can be solved in linear time
    by forward chaining (unit propagation). We also know that every
    tree-structured binary CSP with discrete, finite domains can be
    solved in time linear in the number of variables
    (Section [csp-structure-section](#/)). Are these two
    facts connected? Discuss.

**7.20** Explain why every nonempty propositional clause, by itself, is
satisfiable. Prove rigorously that every set of five 3-SAT clauses is
satisfiable, provided that each clause mentions exactly three distinct
variables. What is the smallest set of such clauses that is
unsatisfiable? Construct such a set.

**7.21** A propositional *2-CNF* expression is a conjunction of
clauses, each containing *exactly 2* literals, e.g.,
$$(A\lor B) \land (\lnot A \lor C) \land (\lnot B \lor D) \land (\lnot
  C \lor G) \land (\lnot D \lor G)\ .$$

1.  Prove using resolution that the above sentence entails $G$.

2.  Two clauses are *semantically distinct* if they are not
    logically equivalent. How many semantically distinct 2-CNF clauses
    can be constructed from $n$ proposition symbols?

3.  Using your answer to (b), prove that propositional resolution always
    terminates in time polynomial in $n$ given a 2-CNF sentence
    containing no more than $n$ distinct symbols.

4.  Explain why your argument in (c) does not apply to 3-CNF.

**7.22** Prove each of the following assertions:

1.  Every pair of propositional clauses either has no resolvents, or all
    their resolvents are logically equivalent.

2.  There is no clause that, when resolved with itself, yields
    (after factoring) the clause $(\lnot P \lor \lnot Q)$.

3.  If a propositional clause $C$ can be resolved with a copy of itself,
    it must be logically equivalent to $ True $.

**7.23** Consider the following sentence:
$$[ ({Food} {\:\;{\Rightarrow}\:\;}{Party}) \lor ({Drinks} {\:\;{\Rightarrow}\:\;}{Party}) ] {\:\;{\Rightarrow}\:\;}[ ( {Food} \land {Drinks} )  {\:\;{\Rightarrow}\:\;}{Party}]\ .$$

1.  Determine, using enumeration, whether this sentence is valid,
    satisfiable (but not valid), or unsatisfiable.

2.  Convert the left-hand and right-hand sides of the main implication
    into CNF, showing each step, and explain how the results confirm
    your answer to (a).

3.  Prove your answer to (a) using resolution.

**7.24** \[dnf-exercise\] A sentence is in disjunctive normal form(DNF) if it is the disjunction of
conjunctions of literals. For example, the sentence
$(A \land B \land \lnot C) \lor (\lnot A \land C) \lor (B \land \lnot C)$
is in DNF.

1.  Any propositional logic sentence is logically equivalent to the
    assertion that some possible world in which it would be true is in
    fact the case. From this observation, prove that any sentence can be
    written in DNF.

2.  Construct an algorithm that converts any sentence in propositional
    logic into DNF. (*Hint*: The algorithm is similar to
    the algorithm for conversion to CNF iven in
    Sectio [pl-resolution-section](#/).)

3.  Construct a simple algorithm that takes as input a sentence in DNF
    and returns a satisfying assignment if one exists, or reports that
    no satisfying assignment exists.

4.  Apply the algorithms in (b) and (c) to the following set of
    sentences:

> $A {\Rightarrow} B$

> $B {\Rightarrow} C$

> $C {\Rightarrow} A$

5.  Since the algorithm in (b) is very similar to the algorithm for
    conversion to CNF, and since the algorithm in (c) is much simpler
    than any algorithm for solving a set of sentences in CNF, why is
    this technique not used in automated reasoning?

**7.25** \[convert-clausal-exercise\] Convert the following set of sentences to
clausal form.

> S1: $A {\;\;{\Leftrightarrow}\;\;}(B \lor E)$.

> S2: $E {\:\;{\Rightarrow}\:\;}D$.

> S3: $C \land F {\:\;{\Rightarrow}\:\;}\lnot B$.

> S4: $E {\:\;{\Rightarrow}\:\;}B$.

> S5: $B {\:\;{\Rightarrow}\:\;}F$.

> S6: $B {\:\;{\Rightarrow}\:\;}C$

Give a trace of the execution of DPLL on the conjunction of these
clauses.

**7.26** \[convert-clausal-exercise\] Convert the following set of sentences to
clausal form.

> S1: $A {\;\;{\Leftrightarrow}\;\;}(C \lor E)$.

> S2: $E {\:\;{\Rightarrow}\:\;}D$.

> S3: $B \land F {\:\;{\Rightarrow}\:\;}\lnot C$.

> S4: $E {\:\;{\Rightarrow}\:\;}C$.

> S5: $C {\:\;{\Rightarrow}\:\;}F$.

> S6: $C {\:\;{\Rightarrow}\:\;}B$

Give a trace of the execution of DPLL on the conjunction of these
clauses.

**7.27** Is a randomly generated 4-CNF sentence with $n$ symbols and $m$ clauses
more or less likely to be solvable than a randomly generated 3-CNF
sentence with $n$ symbols and $m$ clauses? Explain.

**7.28** \[minesweeper-exercise\] Minesweeper, the well-known computer game, is
closely related to the wumpus world. A minesweeper world is
a rectangular grid of $N$ squares with $M$ invisible mines scattered
among them. Any square may be probed by the agent; instant death follows
if a mine is probed. Minesweeper indicates the presence of mines by
revealing, in each probed square, the *number* of mines
that are directly or diagonally adjacent. The goal is to probe every
unmined square.

1.  Let $X_{i,j}$ be true iff square $[i,j]$ contains a mine. Write down
    the assertion that exactly two mines are adjacent to \[1,1\] as a
    sentence involving some logical combination of
    $X_{i,j}$ propositions.

2.  Generalize your assertion from (a) by explaining how to construct a
    CNF sentence asserting that $k$ of $n$ neighbors contain mines.

3.  Explain precisely how an agent can use {DPLL} to prove that a given square
    does (or does not) contain a mine, ignoring the global constraint
    that there are exactly $M$ mines in all.

4.  Suppose that the global constraint is constructed from your method
    from part (b). How does the number of clauses depend on $M$ and $N$?
    Suggest a way to modify {DPLL} so that the global constraint does not need
    to be represented explicitly.

5.  Are any conclusions derived by the method in part (c) invalidated
    when the global constraint is taken into account?

6.  Give examples of configurations of probe values that induce
    *long-range dependencies* such that the contents of a
    given unprobed square would give information about the contents of a
    far-distant square. (*Hint*: consider an
    $N\times 1$ board.)

**7.29** \[known-literal-exercise\] How long does it take to prove
${KB}{\models}\alpha$ using {DPLL} when $\alpha$ is a literal *already
contained in* ${KB}$? Explain.

**7.30** \[dpll-fc-exercise\] Trace the behavior of {DPLL} on the knowledge base in
Figure [pl-horn-example-figure](#/) when trying to prove $Q$,
and compare this behavior with that of the forward-chaining algorithm.

**7.31** Write a successor-state axiom for the ${Locked}$ predicate, which
applies to doors, assuming the only actions available are ${Lock}$ and
${Unlock}$.

**7.32** Discuss what is meant by *optimal* behavior in the wumpus
world. Show that the {Hybrid-Wumpus-Agent} is not optimal, and suggest ways to improve it.

**7.33** Suppose an agent inhabits a world with two states, $S$ and $\lnot S$,
and can do exactly one of two actions, $a$ and $b$. Action $a$ does
nothing and action $b$ flips from one state to the other. Let $S^t$ be
the proposition that the agent is in state $S$ at time $t$, and let
$a^t$ be the proposition that the agent does action $a$ at time $t$
(similarly for $b^t$).

1.  Write a successor-state axiom for $S^{t+1}$.

2.  Convert the sentence in (a) into CNF.

3.  Show a resolution refutation proof that if the agent is in $\lnot S$
    at time $t$ and does $a$, it will still be in $\lnot S$ at time
    $t+1$.

**7.34** \[ss-axiom-exercise\] Section [successor-state-section](#/)
provides some of the successor-state axioms required for the wumpus
world. Write down axioms for all remaining fluent symbols.

**7.35** \[hybrid-wumpus-exercise\]Modify the {Hybrid-Wumpus-Agent} to use the 1-CNF logical state
estimation method described on page [1cnf-belief-state-page](#/). We noted on that page
that such an agent will not be able to acquire, maintain, and use more
complex beliefs such as the disjunction $P_{3,1}\lor P_{2,2}$. Suggest a
method for overcoming this problem by defining additional proposition
symbols, and try it out in the wumpus world. Does it improve the
performance of the agent?
